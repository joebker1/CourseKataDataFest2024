# 📊 ASA DataFest 2024 – CourseKata Student Interaction Analysis

This project was developed for the **2024 ASA DataFest**, a nationwide, 48-hour data science competition involving colleges across the United States.  
Teams are challenged to analyze real-world data and deliver insights under time constraints.

Our team represented **Arizona State University (ASU)** and won **Best Overall Project** among ASU participants, competing against teams from the **University of Arizona (U of A)** and **Northern Arizona University (NAU)**.

## 🎯 Project Goal

Analyze computer logs documenting student interactions with online statistics textbooks to:
- Identify behavioral patterns across learning modules
- Improve the learning experience via actionable insights
- Predict student performance using logistic regression and interaction-based features

---

## 🧠 Methodology

- Cleaned and preprocessed logs from CourseKata
- Engineered features based on:
  - Video watch time
  - Number of problems attempted
  - Repetition frequency and time-on-task
- Applied **Logistic Regression** to categorize students into:
  - High Achievers
  - Medium Achievers
  - Low Achievers

## 🏆 Competition Results

- 🥇 **Award:** Best Overall Project — Arizona State University  
- 🕒 Duration: 48 hours  
- 🧠 Focus: Insight generation, modeling, and presentation under pressure  
- 🎯 Competed against teams from **ASU**, **U of A**, and **NAU**

---

## 💡 Key Recommendations

- Add embedded **multiple-choice questions** between video segments to force interaction (inspired by platforms like Coursera)
- Incorporate **pause-and-answer mechanics** to improve reflection and retention
